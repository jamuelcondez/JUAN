| About JUAN: |
+-------------+
JUAN (JUnit Add-on for Notifications), is a small add-on to JUnit, offering an automated mechanism to alert, or notify, 
team members about events, without breaking the build. This means that the developers can still work as normal, as opposed 
to the traditional JUnit failures, which means that the entire production line does not have to halt. 

Examples on events that do not have to break the build:
 - There is a mismatch between two different localized text resources files (some new properties have not yet been translated).
 - Someone has edited a particularly critical part of the application, and an e-mail is sent to someone who knows this part of the code well that an extra code review is recommended.
